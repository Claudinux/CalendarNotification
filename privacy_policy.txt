As part of normal operation, this app receives and stores information about events fired by Android Calendar

No such information ever leaves application: 

 * it is not transmitted anywhere

 * not shared with anyone

 * not provided to any 3rd party 

All event details are removed once event is dismissed. If user has enabled option to keep recently dismissed 
events - such information is removed as soon as timeout passes  or history is cleared explicitly
